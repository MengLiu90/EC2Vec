Test Case ID: TC001
Description: Verify that EC2Vec correctly embeds a valid EC number.
Preconditions: EC2Vec model is trained and operational.
Test Steps:
  1. Input the EC number "1.1.1.1" into the model.
  2. Retrieve the output embedding.
Test Data: EC number "1.1.1.1".
Expected Result: A 1024-dimensional vector is output without errors.
Actual Result: The model output a 1024-dimensional vector as expected without any errors during the execution. The vector was verified against expected properties and found to be consistent.
Pass/Fail Criteria: The test passes as the output was a 1024-dimensional vector that correctly matches expected properties, confirming the model's accuracy in embedding a valid EC number.
